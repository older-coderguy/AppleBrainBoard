# AppleBrainBoard
Use the BrainBoard to load DOS 3.3 on Apple II power up or control+B Reset. 
Additionally a Control+C Reset will load DOS and then catalog a disk in disk drive #1.
The code expects to be loaded into a 27C256 EPROM (or a EEPROM). Currently the code resides in the bank 0 of the Brain Board.
I found the Brain Board for sale on Ebay. I since have located websites about the board.

I plan to expand this readme as time permits. There are notes in my assembly source code that will be helpful.
