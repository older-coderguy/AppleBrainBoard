# AppleBrainBoard
Use the BrainBoard to load DOS 3.3 on Apple II+ power up or control+B Reset. This code only works in an APPLE II+.
Additionally a Control+C Reset will load DOS and then catalog a disk in disk drive #1.
The code expects to be loaded into a 27C256 EPROM (or a EEPROM). Currently the code resides in the bank 0 of the Brain Board.
I found the Brain Board for sale on Ebay. I since have located websites about the board.

Back in the 80's I converted an Apple ROM card to be a DOS HOSS from Jim Sather's book Understanding the Apple IIe.
I took the ROMs I created from that project and extracted Apple DOS from those ROMs, as well as the F8 monitor code.
I then packed this into a new EPROM. I then figured out a way to transfer the DOS into the Apple, doing it a bit different
than the way Jim did it. Seems to work. Future project will be to add Integer Basic load using the upper bank of ROM in the
Brain Board.
Note that II+ WORKSV8 256k Winbond.HEX is the complete code for the 27c256 EEPROM. If you change the assembly code and compile, you then
need to convert the hex generated by the compiler into hex. Then first load the complete ROM hex file into your eprom programmer software. Then
you can load your new assembly code hex file starting at $1000. This memory location in the EPROM works out as $D000 in the Brain Board.
I plan to expand this readme as time permits. There are notes in my assembly source code that will be helpful.
